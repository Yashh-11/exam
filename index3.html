       <strong>Water is the primary and essential need of every living organism. </strong>It is the most precious gift by nature that helps in survival. 
        <em><strong>70% of our body is filled with water, which is why it is an essential part of our life.</strong></em> Water is needed for various purposes every day.
         We need water for drinking, washing, cleaning, cooking, etc. Just like there is no life without oxygen, there is no existence without water. It exists in the form of seas, oceans, etc., and also in the form of ice. 
        It is not only an essential element for human beings but also crucial for the survival and existence of plants, animals, birds, etc.
